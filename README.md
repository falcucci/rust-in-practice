# Rust In Practice

This repository aims to write some solutions and practice Rust in a daily basis workflow.

I can also put some experiments here accordingly with my needs.

The approach is the same as I learn always writing the test-first.

# Tests

As you have `cargo` installed, just run
```bash
cargo test
```
